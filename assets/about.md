### About Me

Hi! I'm Tony Von Wolfe. This is my (*very* originally named) blog, Life of Tony.

I'm a software engineer. I greatly enjoy learning new things regardless of the
subject; I love learning about new and existing technologies even more! I've
been enthralled with how computers work and what can be done with them ever
since I was a child.

In my spare time I enjoy outdoor activities like skiing, hiking, and camping. I
also like spending time with my wife and miniature wiener dog. I'm an avid
car enthusiast and a hobbyist programmer, too.
