I created this blogging site as part of a web development course I took in university. Currently viewable [here](http://www.tonyvonwolfe.com), the site was written in plain PHP, HTML and CSS, with some jQuery sprinkled in. I have since decided to re-write this site using Vue.js, a modern JavaScript framework that is both performant and robust. It's a work in progress, but the latest build is available [here](http://beta.tonyvonwolfe.com).

Feel free to browse the code, leave feedback, etc.

Happy coding!
