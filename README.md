## Life of Tony
### *(Re-written in Vue.js)*

I created this blogging site as part of a web development course I took in university. Currently viewable [here](www.tonyvonwolfe.com), the site was written in plain PHP, HTML and CSS, with some jQuery sprinkled in. I have since decided to re-write this site using Vue.js, a modern JavaScript framework that is both performant and robust. 

Feel free to browse the code, leave feedback, etc.

Happy coding!
