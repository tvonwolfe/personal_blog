## Life of Tony
### *(Re-written using Vue.js + Nuxt.js)*
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9542feca-49cb-4085-b959-1b6159cee2b2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tender-villani-d00823/deploys)

I originally created this blogging site as part of a web development course I
took in university. It was initially written in plain HTML and CSS with a
tiny bit of jQuery sprinkled in, and PHP running on the backend to talk to a
MySQL server.

I have since decided to re-write this site using Vue.js, a modern JavaScript
framework that is both performant and robust. I also decided to do away with
the PHP and MySQL backend, instead opting for a NoSQL database provided
through Google's Firebase service. I am very interested in learning new
technologies, and web development is also something that I want to learn more
of.

It's a work in progress, but the latest build is available
[here](https://www.tonyvonwolfe.com).

Feel free to browse the code, leave feedback, etc.

Happy coding!
